# NRN_PLY_to_Video
This script is designed to take .ply files describing a neuron morphology and apply a simulated current to the soma of the cell. The simulation then shows the propagation of the voltage through the cells neurites. This propagation of voltage is visualized with a colored .ply file iterated over time resulting in a video.
